## General Information
The ultimate goal of this project was to find a way to drive down future costs for the company. I took all the benchmark data, and made several baseline calculations to create a "status-quo" model. I conducted two-sample t-tests to offer advice around vehicle types, manufacturers, and technical specs.
I discovered that the main parameters that affect probability are: growth rate, compensation structure, quota an headcount. Based off this, I developed three possible strategies,
and saw which of these strategies would have the best effect on the "Status Quo Model":

1)Strategy 1: Assume consistent compensation structure and no growth in headcount. Optimize by assuming company grows its book of business.

2)Strategy 2:Â Modify the pay structure to boost incentives for employees and maximize net revenue.

3)Strategy 3: Increase the headcount.
